<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This site is now (sort of) reachable in Geminispace!</p>
<p>From your gemini browser of choice<sup><a href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup> you can find it at: <a href="gemini://gemini.scottnm.com">gemini://gemini.scottnm.com</a></p>
<p>If you're not familiar with geminispace, you can find a primer here: <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net">https://geminiprotocol.net</a></p>
<p>It's cool. I'm excited to explore geminispace more.</p>
<p>I do find <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/05/28/the-gemini-protocol-seen-by-this-http-client-person/">Daniel Stenberg's thoughts</a> on the protocol pretty interesting. It's a good splash of cold water on some of the ecosystem and protocol's issues. Nevertheless, I'm still excited and hopefully for geminispace's future.</p>
<p>I haven't yet been able to migrate all of this site's posts to geminispace since they're built from Markdown, and Gemtext (Gemini's analogous markup language) is meaningfully (and intentionally) less powerful. My attempts at using naive Markdown-to-Gemtext converters have so far not been very successful and I don't see it being a good use of my time in the near future.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I've run into trouble dealing with missing first-class support for inline links and footnotes.</p>
<p>Oh well. I'll deal and adapt with time.</p>
<p>For now, it's cool to have a space over there even if it's just my homepage linking back to the wider net.</p>
