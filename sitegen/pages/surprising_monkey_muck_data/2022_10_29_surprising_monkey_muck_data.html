    I learned recently that my <a href="https://scottnm.itch.io/muck">"Monkey Muck" demo</a> on itch.io
    has a much larger reach that I ever expected.
</p>

<p>
    As of Oct. 29 2022 (i.e. in <em>just</em> 6 years), Monkey Muck...
</p>

<ul>
    <li>has 2,225 views
    </li>

    <li>has 204 downloads of its Win32 build
    </li>

    <li>is a part of 14 itch.io collections
    </li>
</ul>

    In today's internet landscape, these numbers are incredibly small, but "incredibly small" is still
    about 100x the attention I expected this demo to receive. It makes me wonder what compounding
    coincidences led to any traffic at all. I never shared this demo with anyone (aside from linking it
    on my personal site which I also don't share with anyone), so I have to imagine it's mostly
    coincidence. Maybe having "horror" in the tags list gave it some attention for people browsing
    itch.io for horror games.

    I think my favorite of the above data points is that the demo is in 14 itch.io collections. As far
    as I can tell, there's no (easy) way to set up "smart" collections which fill themselves, so this
    tells me that at least a handful of people thought my demo was worthy of adding to their own
    personal curated lists. Cool!

    This past May, without knowing about these numbers, I went through the exercise of <a href=
    "https://github.com/scottnm/MonkeyMuck/commit/e5b27902d21ddd8ce8ebaf661dccc0e8f29ac12d">revisiting
    this demo and adding a WebGL build</a>. My motivation for doing this was purely nostalgia; I wanted
    to revisit something I'd made years ago and see if it was still tweakable. It was, and I was able to
    publish the WebGL version on my itch page so that folks could play it without having to download and
    run a Win32 binary. In 5 months, it's only gotten 4 browser plays, so I'm glad my motivation wasn't
    anything more. Maybe 6 years from now, I'll come back to Muck's analytics dashboard and see 200
    browser plays! Wouldn't that be funny.
