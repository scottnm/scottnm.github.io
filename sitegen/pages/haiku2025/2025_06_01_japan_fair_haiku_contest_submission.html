<p>I entered a <a href="https://www.japanfairus.org/2025-haiku-workshop-contest">haiku contest</a>.</p>
<p>
    I don't have much experience writing haiku or poetry more broadly, but I do have a long-time love affair with clever
    wordplay<sup><a href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup
    >.
</p>
<p>
    So, I gave it my best shot! I spent a week jotting down ideas and reading through haiku: both popular works and
    previous contest submissions.
</p>
<p>We were allowed to submit two haiku. Here's what I submitted:</p>
<p><strong>Submission 1</strong></p>
<div class="poem">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            phase through hands<br />
            in time with the budding chorus<br />
            we both drop
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Submission 2</strong></p>
<div class="poem">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            dawn flips the "open" sign<br />
            first in line for the first tomatoes;<br />
            sunrise on the vine
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

            >Curious why these don't fit the 5-7-5 format? More below<sup><a href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup></i
        ></small
    >
</p>
<p>
    It was a fulfilling and challenging exercise! The first submission in particular, I felt like I drafted so many
    different variations of each line: altering word choice, syllable count, meter, seasonal references, and poetic
    turns.
</p>
<p>
    After drafting and re-drafting, I was basically down to two candidates: what I submitted above and this alternate
    that I left on the cutting room floor.
</p>
<p><strong>Submission 1: original</strong></p>
<div class="poem">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            phase through swarming flesh<br />
            strike earth! ring drowns out chorus<br />
            stars bloom above me
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p>There was a lot that I liked in this original form:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It followed the (admittedly unnecessary) 5-7-5 pattern.</li>
    <li>
        The word choice had a bit more <em>grime</em> and <strong>violence</strong> which better fit the original spirit
        of the poem.
    </li>
    <li>I liked the double entendre of the final line.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Ultimately, I went with the variation I submitted because I felt its terseness better fit the tone and style of
    haiku. And while I loved using words like "flesh", "swarming", and "strike", the more I read both variations out loud
    to myself, the more I felt the meter of the original was a bit clumsy: words felt absent out of necessity to fit the
    5-7-5 pattern and the rhythm of the words I left behind didn't really flow.
</p>
<p>
    I think I made the right choice. I get the sense that, for haiku, there's value in celebrating shorter moments. The
    submitted poem narrowed the scope and left more to the imagination of its outcomes. The abandoned original described
    more of a narrative and got lost trying to fit in my pet favorite phrases.
</p>
<p>I'm excited to see which submissions get selected!</p>

        [2] The contest I was submitting to explicitly allowed/encouraged poems to deviate beyond the 5-7-5 form. It
        seems broadly felt that the
        <a href="https://www.graceguts.com/essays/urban-myth-of-5-7-5">5-7-5 restriction is a misunderstanding</a> of the
        original Japanese form and that there are other elements which play a much stronger role in making something a
        haiku: seasonal references, juxtaposition, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji">kireji</a>.<br />
