<p>"VTPP" (for "Video-to-Private-Podcast) is a Raspberry Pi application with two main components:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        a "fetcher" which downloads videos from external sources(s)<sup id="fnref:1"
            ><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup
        >
        and extracts their audio.
    </li>
    <li>a database of these downloads which is dynamically served as a podcast feed.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Together, this enables me to automatically generate a podcast feed of audio from the latest videos of a select
    handful of youtube channels.
</p>

        style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%"
    />
</p>
<p>For me it's been surprisingly useful!</p>
<p>I'm not yet interested in publishing the source for anyone else to use because:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        I haven't built it for anyone else to use so it's still held up with metaphorical scotch date and paperclips in
        some places that I don't think would be pleasant for anyone to use
    </li>
    <li>The source isn't "good enough" to warrant reading even for educational purposes</li>
    <li>
        The source really isn't that interesting. It's mostly a wrapper around sqlite and youtube-dl, just packaged in a
        UX that works for me.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless I'm proud of it.</p>
<p>
    I haven't made any updates in a few years, but just in case the sun ever shines on this codebase again, I'll keep a
    log of all past and future updates here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/pages/vtpp/0.2.0/2023_12_13_vtpp_0.2.0.html">Update v0.2.0</a></li>
    <li><a href="/pages/vtpp/0.1.0/2023_11_04_vtpp_0.1.0.html">Update v0.1.0</a></li>

            <p>
                Today, the only real supported source is YouTube, but supporing other feed sources would be desirable
                future improvements.&#160;<a
