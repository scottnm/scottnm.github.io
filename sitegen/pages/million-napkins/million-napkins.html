<p>The number 1,000,000 has a center gravity to it.</p>
<p>
    Maybe it's cultural conditioning: growing up in the US, being a millionaire felt like having the absolute most money
    that was possible to have. It was so special, it got its own title!
</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, I often daydream about mundane values stacking up to the millions.</p>

    Answer: It's take you 100 days (~14 weeks) to walk a million steps at the above rate. That's way shorter than I would
    have expected! If you started January 1st and walked 10,000 steps every day you'd have walked a 1,000,000 steps
    before mid-April! Even if you're less active and can only walk 5,000 steps per day, you'd still walk the full million
    before the end of July! Wow!

    But... that's not quite right, is it? I'm already taking <em>huge</em> liberties to assume this hypothetical person
    could type at a consistent 85 WPM. But, I feel like I should factor in <em>some</em> amount of humanness. After all,
    I think the estimate is more fun when it's estimating what is possible at reasonable human scale.

    For one thing, people don't work 24 hours a day. They work 8 hours a day. Well really, it's more like 7.5 if you
    discount a half-hour lunch<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup
    >. And even that's more like 7, if you only factor in occassional bathroom and water breaks. Which still feels
    unrealistic... especially for a physically-taxing repetitive task like typing. Let's instead plan out a day around

    So in a regular 9-to-5 work day with reasonable breaks (but probably still not enough breaks to avoid carpal tunnel),
    you're looking at 5 hours and 50 minutes of work. Let's factor that in!

    Wow! Over a month of very regular, well-paced typing to write a million words. I can only imagine the psychic damage
    this would do to someone. No, thank you!
