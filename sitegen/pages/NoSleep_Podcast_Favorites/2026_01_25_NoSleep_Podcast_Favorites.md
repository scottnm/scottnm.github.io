    <summary>S5E18: <a href="https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/episodes/s5/5x18">The "Soft White Damn" series</a></summary>
    <p>Something's haunting Danny. It follows him across the country at first asking then demanding to be let in. This is a four-part series and its worth following to the end! I love how every episode has its own "seasonal" flavor.</p>

    <summary>S23 Extras: <a href="https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/episodes/extras/sd23">Sleepless Decompositions Vol. 23</a></summary>
    I'm usually not a huge fan of the "Sleepless Decompositions" series, but I really liked the voicemail framing device used in "After the Tone."
