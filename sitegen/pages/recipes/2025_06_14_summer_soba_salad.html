    I've made this tasty cold noodle bowl quite a few times recently. It's too simple to warrant calling this a
    "recipe"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup
    >, but I wanted to jot it down anyway for posterity and sharing.

                No need to over worry about uniformity. Just try to get everything in the same ballpark of size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rough chop your salad greens into smaller pieces, as well. Again, no hard rules but the closer in size to
                your diced vegetable mix the better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set your salad greens in your bowl as a base. I like to push them to one side of the bowl to make room
                for the noodles later.
            </li>
            <li>Top the greens with the vegetable mix</li>
            <li>
                Prepare your soba according to package instructions. The kind I buy from Safeway are just "boil in water
                for 5 minutes."
            </li>
            <li>
                Once soba is done, rinse under cold water in strainer until cold to the touch. Shake off as much excess
                water as is convenient. They'll never not be wet, but you don't want to soba salad to get a secondary
                tap-water dressing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add noodles to bowl. For me, I put them in the reserved half of the bowl besides the salad greens (not on
                top of them.)
            </li>
            <li>Dress the noodles and salad with soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Top with optional egg sliced to your preferences</li>
            <li>Enjoy ♡ ☼</li>

                It's basically just pasta salad or mazemen. Use the rough shape and experiment with other variations of
                vegetable mixes, toppings, and pasta types! What about subbing the sesame oil + soba for linguine + olive
                oil + lemon + garlic? Sounds pretty tasty to me... Embrace your inner

                Of course, any bowl will work. But I'm becoming more opinionated that wide noodle bowls are
                <em>infinitely</em> better for most things which work best with a bowl. The big win for this recipe is
                the ease with which you can stir and mix the dish as you eat it. More narrow bowls that you (at least,
                <em>I</em>) would use for cereal are just too cramped and the second you try to dig in a bunch of pieces
                are going to end up outside of your bowl.&#160;<a

                Anna Ladd's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69sY1wzBy44">"how to make a very good salad"</a> is
                a "must watch" and taught me two things:<br />
                1. Prepping a big batch of salad mix (all the non-green salad toppings), makes salads so much less
                annoying to make.<br />
                2. Salads built from small, roughly equal sized pieces are just better. They are easier to eat, they make
                less mess, they mix better with dressing&#160;<a
