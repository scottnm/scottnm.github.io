    Five or so years ago, I found a recipe for "Fantasy Fudge" online and the source link is now dead. My wife is very
    particular about fudge and has proclaimed this to be <em>the</em> recipe she remembers growing up, so I'm archiving
    it for reference. I suspect other online fudge recipes may be an exact copy of this or otherwise closely resemble
    this. But I prefer to have my own archive.
