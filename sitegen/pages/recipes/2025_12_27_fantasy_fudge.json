    "intro": "Five or so years ago, I found a recipe for \"Fantasy Fudge\" online and the source link is now dead. My wife is very particular about fudge and has proclaimed this to be *the* recipe she remembers growing up, so I'm archiving it for reference. I suspect other online fudge recipes may be an exact copy of this or otherwise closely resemble this. But I prefer to have my own archive.",
