        <ul>
            <li>
                Cook 4 strips of bacon like 75% of the way through in a large stock pot rendering out the fat (should
                only take a handful of minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Remove bacon from stockpot leaving rendered out bacon fat behind</li>
            <li>(Optional) if you really want to pack a punch, add the extra, optional tbsp of bacon fat</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic cloves and let cook but not fry in bacon fat for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Add two cups of water to stock pot to deglaze the pot</li>
            <li>Stir and scrap to get any good bits off the bottom of the pot</li>

            <li>Mix well to incorporate collards, bacon, and broth together</li>
            <li>Press collards mixture down into pot a bit if they're sitting too high above the broth mixture</li>
            <li>
                Top with just enough water so that if you press down on the collards, you can see the water just below
            </li>
            <li>Cover pot and let simmer or 1.5 to 2 hours</li>
            <li>Stir occassionally to ensure collards cook and wilt evenly</li>
            <li>
                Check on broth throughout and adjust the heat so that the broth reduces to a good
