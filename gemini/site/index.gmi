# Scott Munro
## Hello
Sometimes, I'm a software engineer working for Xbox. When I'm not, I like to make things. Here you'll find a (lightly pruned) archive of such things. Most of it's code, some of it's not, and all of it's useful to no one but myself! Take a look around.

Still working to re-format my posts for geminispace. Until then, most things will just link back to my main site.
