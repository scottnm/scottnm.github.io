                        "VTPP" is a home server project I've been working on which, in short, automatically downloads
                        videos, extracts their audio, and makes the audio available for me to listen as a podcast feed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's been about a month since I marked a <a href=
                        "/pages/vtpp/0.1.0/2023_11_04_vtpp_0.1.0.html"><code>v0.1.0</code></a> version of the
                        project. Here's what's I've changed since then:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Updated the web portal to enable editing the configured youtube channel list that I'm fetching
                        videos from
                        </li>

                        <li>Updated the web portal so that I can delete videos from my feed as well as "block" videos from
                        being re-downloaded in the future.
                        </li>

                        <li>Added a simple time heuristic to recognize (and ignore) Youtube Shorts when fetching videos
                        </li>

                        <li>Added logic to ignore offline Youtube Live streams which sometimes(?) show up in a channel's
                        feed
                        </li>

                        <li>Made a handful of small improvements to make "on demand" download progress clearer
                        </li>

                        <li>Refactored a bunch of things to make code more reusable across the different components
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        There are still a lot of things I could do and would like to do, but the project is at a point where
                        things feel polished enough that I can "just" use it without feeling like anything is missing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, I'm going to mark this point as a new version, <code>v0.2.0</code>, and let things be for a bit.
                        It'll give me some clarity on what work from the backlog is actually worth spending my weekends on.
