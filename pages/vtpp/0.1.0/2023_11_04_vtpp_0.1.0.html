                <div class="e-content">
                    <p>
                        I've been chipping away at a fun idea, and it's far enough along now that I feel like sharing it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For now, the name I've been using is "VTPP" (Video-to-Private-Podcast), and the concept is simple:
                        it's a home server which periodically downloads videos from external source(s)<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>, strips the audio
                        from those videos, and serves that audio in a podcast feed accessible from my home network<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The server also supports downloading specific videos without subscribing to an entire video feed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So far, all this has worked really well!
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The server itself does very little work, so I've been able to run it off a spare Raspberry Pi
                        that was collecting dust.
                        </li>

                        <li>There are more than a few YouTube channels where I only want to listen to the videos (usually
                        during repeat watches/listens). It's nice to save power and turn off my phone screen while
                        listening, which YouTube's current UI/UX/business policies prohibit without paying them.
                        </li>

                        <li>The size of the downloaded audio is more than manageable for my server's storage. Enough that I
                        haven't bothered to worry about figuring out how to manage running out space in a smart<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> way.
                        </li>

                        <li>I haven't been able to get most iOS podcast apps to connect to my home server, but I did find
                        one that is really great so far: RSS Radio.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I don't yet intend to package this for anyone else to use or even to make the source available, but
                        the concept is pretty simple to implement. If you like the idea, feel free to implement your own
                        version! I'm not the idea police. No way I was the first one to think of this idea (I never bothered
                        checking...).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here are some screenshots of it working in action!
                    </p>

                                Here's a quick demo of my phone playing an episode from the podcast feed.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Here's a quick demo of me requesting a video be downloaded on-demand to my feed server from my phone,
                                followed by the audio becoming available within the podcast feed on my phone.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="vtpp-demo-pic" >

                            <p>
                                To make it easier to monitor the health of the server, I added Discord webhook support. If the server runs into
                                trouble, it'll send error reports with logs to a private discord server I setup. And when new videos are successfully
                                downloaded, I get a quick summary of what's been downloaded.

                        Problems with podcast apps
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, I haven't yet been able to get my home feed working with my longtime-preferred
                        podcast app, "Overcast", or the "Apple Podcasts" app. These apps allow you to subscribe to
                        user-provided feed URLs, but when I try to use the address of my home server it fails with a
                        non-specific error message saying it couldn't use the URL.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I still haven't quite figured out what the problem is, but I did spend a little time trying to
                        investigate. Or rather, I spent a few days trying to capture the app's HTTPS traffic with Fiddler,
                        and, when I couldn't get that to work, I ran out of ideas on how to gather data necessary to
                        investigate where/why fetching my feed was failing. Some suspicions I have include...
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>I believe these apps probably do cert pinning. At the very least, I'm pretty sure this is why I
                        wasn't able to Fiddler the HTTPS traffic, and it doesn't seem totally out of the realm of
                        possibility that these apps require HTTPS authenticated feeds (which I haven't setup yet) and
                        possibly pin certs for a handful of well-known feed services.
                        </li>

                        <li>It's possible that these apps do some validation/sanitization of the user-provided URLs intended
                        to guard against having the apps fetch data from malicious sources.
                        </li>

                        <li>It's possible that these apps don't handle URLs well using the hostname format I'm specifying.
                        I've tried using addresses of the form <code>http://{hostname}:{port}/</code> and <code>
                            http://{hostname}.local:{port}/</code> and neither seemed to make a difference.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Though it just occurs to me that I was always using and specifying a development port
                                rather than the standard port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS). Maybe I'll try exposing the server
                                on port 80, omitting the port in the URL, and seeing if that changes anything.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 id="a-thought-on-security" class="section-title">
                        A Thought on Security...
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        I am not a programmer with a lot of security expertise, but I'd be remiss to not reflect on a
                        possible (probable?) security gap that I haven't yet addressed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is...
                        <ol>
                            <li>the feed is currently served via HTTP and not HTTPS.
                            </li>

                            <li>the feed's address is my feed's hostname on the local network and not some reserved public
                            internet name.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There's nothing preventing my phone from trying to reach this hostname on a network other than my
                        home network, unexpectedly resolving the wrong host, and trying to talk to something/someone it
                        shouldn't. Of course, the likelihood of this happening is minimal, and, in theory, the attack
                        surface is isolated to my podcast app (which is why I haven't frontloaded addressing it), but I'd
                        still feel more comfortable knowing the security gap wasn't there at all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think the right way to fix it would probably be to expose the feed from an HTTPS endpoint with a
                        cert that chains back to some trusted root. Or maybe I could get by using a self-signed cert that I
                        keep secure and installing that self-signed cert on my phone. Maybe there's an even further future
                        where I could somehow setup some cert pinning such that only my self-signed cert would be trusted
                        when trying to reach my feed (though I think that implies writing my own bespoke podcast app which
                        is... uh... a little more work than I'm excited about).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Guess that's a problem for future-me.

                        Future Improvements
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Speaking of the future, while I'm comfortable with where this project is right now and may let it
                        rest for a while there are a handful of features on my wish list that I'd like to address
                        eventually:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Make more of the feed's runtime behavior configurable from the web portal (i.e., managing
                        currently subscribed channels and shared metadata)
                        </li>

                        <li>Enable better management of the feeds from the web portal (i.e., deleting items from the feed
                        that I no longer want/need)
                        </li>

                        <li>Make setting up the server more "plug-n-play" with docker containers
                        </li>

                        <li>Flagging some content to not be downloaded (e.g., YouTube shorts)
                        </li>

                        <li>Setting up an automatic eviction policy for older downloads
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Here's to hoping I get around to this stuff!
