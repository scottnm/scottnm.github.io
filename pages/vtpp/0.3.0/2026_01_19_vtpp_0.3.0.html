          <p>"VTPP" is a home server project I've been working on which, in short, automatically downloads videos, extracts their audio, and makes the audio available for me to listen as a podcast feed.</p>
          <p>It's been a few years since I marked the <a href="/pages/vtpp/0.2.0/2023_12_13_vtpp_0.2.0.html"
            ><code>v0.2.0</code></a
          > milestone.</p>
          <p>
            I've finally gotten around to fixing some of the project's basic security issues, so it felt right to mark this point as the <code>v0.3.0</code> release!
          </p>
          <h2>HTTPS and proper hostnames</h2>
          <p>As noted all the way back in <a href="/pages/vtpp/0.1.0/2023_11_04_vtpp_0.1.0.html#a-thought-on-security">the v0.1.0 release</a>, I've connected to my VTPP feed and server over HTTP and using a static, private IP address.</p>
          <p>
            After more than two years, this has still yet to cause a real problem, but it's a pretty significant security gap: Using a static, private IP address from a mobile device exposed me to the possibility of using a public WiFi network with a similar private IP range and accidentally
            connecting to someone or something I did not intend to.
          </p>
          <p>And using HTTP meant that if I did connect to something, my phone wouldn't make any attempt to authenticate that it was the VTPP feed my phone was expecting.</p>
          <p>Both issues have now been addressed.</p>
          <p>
            Over the christmas break, I coincidentally set up a <a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-Hole</a> DNS server on my home network. Fixing the "connect-via-IP" problem was as simple as adding a new <code>vtpp.lemonpie.home.arpa</code> entry to the DNS server's records that mapped back to the
            VTPP server's static IP address. For a long time, I thought fixing the hostname issue would require registering (and paying for) a real public hostname which isn't really what I wanted or needed. Discovering the
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8375"
              ><code>home.arpa</code> domain</a
            >
            made the solution so easy!
          </p>
          <p>
            And I chose to fix the HTTPS problem by setting up my own private certificate authority (CA), installing it as a trusted root on the devices which use VTPP, and then issuing a server leaf certificate for my VTPP server to use. The server certificate encodes both the hostname,
            <code>vtpp.lemonpie.home.arpa</code>, and the static IP as SANs (subject alternative names).
          </p>
          <p>
            For now this is a workable situation for me. I would prefer to get my leaf cert issued from a more widely available trust anchor like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">LetsEncrypt</a>, but I haven't yet figured out how to get one issued for a service only reachable on my private network.
            I think specialized tools like <a href="https://localcert.net/dashboard">localcert.net</a> exist to help bridge this gap, but I have not yet had the time to explore what the trade-offs are or how to use it.
          </p>
          <p>I'd bet dollars to donuts that I'll get tired of managing my private CA after the first time I have to deal with a certificate expiration.</p>
          <p>Oh well, for now I'm satisfied.</p>
          <h2>A quick reflection</h2>
          <p>It's funny. Now that the work is done, it feels like it was easy enough that I really shouldn't have put off this bare-minimum security work for over two years. </p>
          <p>
            But I think this is a feeling that only makes sense with those two years of experience under my belt. Despite being an engineer on a team that primarily develops, troubleshoots, and maintains networking software/tooling, DNS and PKI have always been two significant gaps in my skillset.
            I've fixed bugs rooted to problems in both areas in the past, but there's a real difference between having an abstract understanding of those systems and getting your hands up close and dirty with them. So, I suppose it's more of a happy accident that my job has put me face-to-face with
            these systems more directly <em>and</em> more consistently over the last two years.
          </p>
          <p>I feel both embarassed and re-assured that I have no reason to be. Such is life.</p>
          <p>
            <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>
          </p>
          <h2>The full changelog</h2>
          <p>
            Here's a more complete summary of what's changed since <code>v0.2.0</code>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The VTPP homepage now reports the last time the fetcher ran and, uniquely, the last time the fetcher ran with errors.</li>
            <li>Discord reports are only generated when something changes or the fetcher encounters an error.</li>
            <li>
              I added support for enabling/disabling the fetcher schedule from the VTPP homepage.
              <ul>
                <li>YouTube breaks youtube-dl often enough that when something is broken for more than a day, it's more practical to just disable the fetcher until I can try to fix things over the next weekend.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              I improved my "YouTube Shorts" recognition heuristic.
              <ul>
                <li>Instead of looking for a maximum time, I just look for a "shorts"-path in the video URL. This seems to be both simpler and doesn't require successfully downloading any part of the video.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              VTPP now serves its feed and media from an HTTPS endpoint.
              <ul>
                <li>HTTPS support is provided by putting an Nginx reverse proxy in front of the VTPP feed.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The VTPP feed is now reachable from a DNS name resolvable on my local network.</li>
            <li>The VTPP feed is now behind an Nginx reverse proxy and exposed on the proper 443 HTTPS port.</li>
          </ul>
