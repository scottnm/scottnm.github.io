                        I learned recently that my <a href="https://scottnm.itch.io/muck">"Monkey Muck" demo</a> on itch.io
                        has a much larger reach that I ever expected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As of Oct. 29 2022 (i.e. in <em>just</em> 6 years), Monkey Muck...
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>has 2,225 views
                        </li>

                        <li>has 204 downloads of its Win32 build
                        </li>

                        <li>is a part of 14 itch.io collections

                    <p>
                        In today's internet landscape, these numbers are incredibly small, but "incredibly small" is still
                        about 100x the attention I expected this demo to receive. It makes me wonder what compounding
                        coincidences led to any traffic at all. I never shared this demo with anyone (aside from linking it
                        on my personal site which I also don't share with anyone), so I have to imagine it's mostly
                        coincidence. Maybe having "horror" in the tags list gave it some attention for people browsing
                        itch.io for horror games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think my favorite of the above data points is that the demo is in 14 itch.io collections. As far
                        as I can tell, there's no (easy) way to set up "smart" collections which fill themselves, so this
                        tells me that at least a handful of people thought my demo was worthy of adding to their own
                        personal curated lists. Cool!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This past May, without knowing about these numbers, I went through the exercise of <a href=
                        "https://github.com/scottnm/MonkeyMuck/commit/e5b27902d21ddd8ce8ebaf661dccc0e8f29ac12d">revisiting
                        this demo and adding a WebGL build</a>. My motivation for doing this was purely nostalgia; I wanted
                        to revisit something I'd made years ago and see if it was still tweakable. It was, and I was able to
                        publish the WebGL version on my itch page so that folks could play it without having to download and
                        run a Win32 binary. In 5 months, it's only gotten 4 browser plays, so I'm glad my motivation wasn't
                        anything more. Maybe 6 years from now, I'll come back to Muck's analytics dashboard and see 200
                        browser plays! Wouldn't that be funny.
