                    VTPP 0.2.0
                </h1>

                <p>
                    "VTPP" is a home server project I've been working on which, in short, automatically downloads
                    videos, extracts their audio, and makes the audio available for me to listen as a podcast feed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's been about a month since I marked a <a href=
                    "/pages/bespoke/vtpp/0.1.0/2023_11_04_vtpp_0.1.0.html"><code>v0.1.0</code></a> version of the
                    project. Here's what's I've changed since then:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Updated the web portal to enable editing the configured youtube channel list that I'm fetching
                    videos from
                    </li>

                    <li>Updated the web portal so that I can delete videos from my feed as well as "block" videos from
                    being re-downloaded in the future.
                    </li>

                    <li>Added a simple time heuristic to recognize (and ignore) Youtube Shorts when fetching videos
                    </li>

                    <li>Added logic to ignore offline Youtube Live streams which sometimes(?) show up in a channel's
                    feed
                    </li>

                    <li>Made a handful of small improvements to make "on demand" download progress clearer
                    </li>

                    <li>Refactored a bunch of things to make code more reusable across the different components
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are still a lot of things I could do and would like to do, but the project is at a point where
                    things feel polished enough that I can "just" use it without feeling like anything is missing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, I'm going to mark this point as a new version, <code>v0.2.0</code>, and let things be for a bit.
                    It'll give me some clarity on what work from the backlog is actually worth spending my weekends on.
