# VTPP 0.2.0

"VTPP" is a home server project I've been working on which, in short, automatically downloads videos, extracts their audio, and makes the audio available for me to listen as a podcast feed.

It's been about a month since I marked a [`v0.1.0`](/pages/bespoke/vtpp/0.1.0/2023_11_04_vtpp_0.1.0.html) version of the project. Here's what's I've changed since then:

- Updated the web portal to enable editing the configured youtube channel list that I'm fetching videos from
- Updated the web portal so that I can delete videos from my feed as well as "block" videos from being re-downloaded in the future.
- Added a simple time heuristic to recognize (and ignore) Youtube Shorts when fetching videos
- Added logic to ignore offline Youtube Live streams which sometimes(?) show up in a channel's feed
- Made a handful of small improvements to make "on demand" download progress clearer
- Refactored a bunch of things to make code more reusable across the different components

There are still a lot of things I could do and would like to do, but the project is at a point where things feel polished enough that I can "just" use it without feeling like anything is missing.

So, I'm going to mark this point as a new version, `v0.2.0`, and let things be for a bit. It'll give me some clarity on what work from the backlog is actually worth spending my weekends on.
