                    The Treachery of Self-Image
                </h1>

                <p>
                    What the hell is this?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Well, back in 2018, I was bored and killing time. I decided to try to do some digital painting in
                    Paint Tool Sai and wound up with this silly parody of Rene Magritte's "the Treachery of Images".
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had a lot of fun painting it. It was just dumb enough (both in concept and in execution) that I
                    was constantly chuckling to myself. And at the end of it all, I liked how it turned out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm making this page 6 years later and it's still pretty funny to me, but I'm also a bit embarrassed
                    that it doesn't look quite as good as I remember thinking it did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also don't remember why I called it "the Treachery of Self-Image" aside from the obvious
                    wordplay/parody of the source material. Why "self-image"? the world will never know.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Oh well, here it is.
                </p>
