                                            <div class="entry_description">Paranoid Void is a japanese rock outfit and their debut(?) album
                                                "Literary Math" sees the band toying around in a pretty progressive/experimental place. The
                                                guitars flip between enormous ethereal, yet distorted echo tones and a twangy jam-band
                                                sound. The bass is incredibly present in the mix and is often found riffing right alongside
                                                the guitars. I'm no drummer so I have difficulty describing the drums (maybe bombastic?),
                                                but they feel like a lot of fun. I've come back to this album A LOT this year and it's the
                                                reason I made an exception to allow for albums from the end of 2017 to make this list.
                                                Sadly, I don't speak japanese so a lot of the vocal themes are lost on me. But despite the
                                                language barrier, I still love this album.</div>

                                                This album is melting snow at the end of winter break. This album is 20% melancholy and 80%
                                                cute incarnate. Tranquil synths meet buzzy melodica(?) meet acoustic strings in a short,
                                                11-minute, instrumental package that just makes me feel good inside. Multiple tracks seem to
                                                revisit and transform the same musical motifs over and over again. To some this might sound
                                                repetitive but I find it really creative and fun. It may be the only way an 11-minute album

                                                favorite album in the "instrumental" space that I stumbled across this year. Lots of

                                                synth tones such as the bloopy foundation of the title track, "Cannonball!." Vocally,
                                                Morimoto has a soft, monotonous vibe that meshes well with his vocal delivery and
                                                occasionally touches on something that sounds mildly annoyed (see: This is Not). I had the
                                                pleasure of seeing Sen Morimoto perform live this year and it was a blast. The drumming was
                                                insane, the saxophone was powerful, and the tone was inviting.</div>

                                            <div class="entry_description">"Our Place" is absolutely the album I most respect from 2018. I
                                                wish I had a better word than "experimental" to describe it. It's beautiful. It fuses art
                                                rock, folk, and spacey psychedelic (psy-fi?) music into a narrative of existential fear and
                                                acceptance framed by the death of of a loved one. The heart and soul of this album is the
                                                dynamism that drives all 34 minutes of it. The intensity and composition of the music
                                                drastically shifts and changes from moment to moment. Pounding drums give way to whirring
                                                strings. Whirring strings give way to squealing synths. Vocal delivery softens and explodes,
                                                not at random, but exactly when it should. Some tracks like "Waiting Room" have more
                                                straightforward composition. Others like "Bless the Decomposers" could practically rub
                                                elbows with `musique concrete` tunes. Best of all, despite all of this shifting and changing
                                                and transforming, the album feels cohesive; it makes sense from start to end.</div>

                                                chaotic and quick with instrumentation that sounds like every sound ever sampled is being
                                                thrown at you all at once. Everything about it feels intentionally difficult to parse
                                                including its visual presentation which features mysterious gumball-machine-figures with
                                                dunce caps and glossy marble exteriors. That being said, I think the confusing presentation
                                                may be one of my favorite aspects of the music. I love the character art, the black and
                                                white design of the split EPs, and the visual world building around the music. Maybe at some
                                                very very very far removed level it reminds me of my first, notably confused-yet-intrigued
                                                experience with The Chariot and their album "One Wing." Everyday is certainly not an

                                                satisfying than this special combination of crystalline synths, robotronic drums, distorted

                                            <div class="entry_description">Delta Sleep's "Ghost City" is an album that knows where to draw
                                                the line between being "Mathy" and being palatable. Rhythmically, the album adopts a lot of
                                                the jerky,rapid-start-stop patterns that I love without sacrificing memorable hooks or
                                                catchy motifs in their melodies. There are a lot of familiar math-rock-y timbres and tones
                                                on this album: bright guitars, indie-rock vocals, and sharp drums. Narratively the album
                                                touches upon themes of "nature vs machine" that I find a bit goofy and cliche, but the
                                                themes are sonically well-supported and delivered. I don't think this is an album that will
                                                convince anyone to like math rock if they don't already, but it might convince them it's not
                                                a hopeless contest to write the least presentable music in the holy name of "odd time

                                                self-importance and coincided with a period of my life where I spent hours getting lost in
                                                "lofi hip hop" youtube playlists (don't tell anyone but I still do sometimes). Months later,
                                                I was disappointed when the debut EP "In Tongues" released and didn't hook me the same way.
                                                I haven't figured out why. Maybe I just fell out of love with the somber, romantic style of
                                                mumbly RnB. Regardless, I didn't pay much mind when he dropped the single "Yeah Right" and I
                                                kept my distance from the summer pop album that he dropped with the rest of his 88rising
                                                labelmates. "Ballads 1" has me tuned back in though. The album is not without its problems
                                                -- the obnoxious bass on "Attention", the grimey guitar solo on "Wanted U", the test
                                                drive/long ride wordplay on "Test Drive" -- but I think the good largely outweighs the bad
                                                on the album. The chorus to "Wanted U" and the entirety of "Why Am I Still in LA" could go
                                                toe-to-toe with some of my favorite emo tracks. The rising vocal composition on "Slow
                                                Dancing in the Dark" pairs beautifully with the synthetic harp and buzzy synth that forms
                                                the song's musical foundation. "Can't Get Over You" is short-n-sweet with minimal production
                                                that makes every harp pluck, every drum hit, and every clap that much more memorable.</div>

                                                but a lot of it feels foreign to me. It's a blend of jazz, progrock, mathrock, and ambient
                                                electronic music (ala C418) that either has me bobbing my head or scratching it. It's a very
                                                indulgent record with long track-times and wandering arrangements that can make you feel
                                                lost if you don't know what to expect. But this indulgence affords them the opportunity to
                                                write an album that always has something new to discover. I first found this band through
                                                their stellar Audiotree Live performance awhile ago and was pleasantly surprised to find
                                                their drummer was Nnamdi Ogbannaya who took a spot in my "favorite albums of 2017" last year
                                                with his release "Drool."</div>
