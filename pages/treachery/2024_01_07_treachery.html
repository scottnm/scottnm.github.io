                    <p>
                        What the hell is this?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Well, back in 2018, I was bored and killing time. I decided to try to do some digital painting in
                        Paint Tool Sai and wound up with this silly parody of Rene Magritte's "the Treachery of Images".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had a lot of fun painting it. It was just dumb enough (both in concept and in execution) that I
                        was constantly chuckling to myself. And at the end of it all, I liked how it turned out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm making this page 6 years later and it's still pretty funny to me, but I'm also a bit embarrassed
                        that it doesn't look quite as good as I remember thinking it did.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also don't remember why I called it "the Treachery of Self-Image" aside from the obvious
                        wordplay/parody of the source material. Why "self-image"? the world will never know.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh well, here it is.
                    </p>
