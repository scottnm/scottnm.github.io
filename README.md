# www.scottnm.com

The source for my personal site, [http://www.scottnm.com](http://www.scottnm.com).

For simplicity's sake, the whole site is implemented with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla ES6 JS.

## Layout

* `index.html`: main page
* `styles.css`: stylesheet shared across all pages
* `pages/`: HTML files for subpages 
* `scripts/`: JS scripts for the main page and all subpages
* `site_images/`: assets for the main site layout
* `files/`: assets for projects and pages
* `blog_drafts/`: markdown drafts for blog posts
* `blog_posts/`: HTML blog posts generated from markdown drafts in `blog_drafts/`

## Redesign

NOTE: I'm currently iterating on a redesign of this website (as of Dec 30th 2023) so there may be some stray files lying around related to that which are unrelated to the current publicly available website.
